## Running the program
1) Open the ```.../Nickname-generator``` folder in your terminal
2) Type: 
```
python3 main.py
```
## How it works?

When you execute the program, it will show this message: "Would you like to suggest a specific word?"
it means that you can choose one or more words to add into your nickname. You can refuse it.

Then after the program ask you if you want to add some words or not in the nickname, it will ask if you want to suggest any number
to put in too ("would you like to add some numbers?")

After those two steps the program will generate some nicknames based in what you preferences.
